</table>Press the "Connect" button to connect to DerMixD and after a

can also switch to the other player instantly by pressing the
"Next"-Button.
<p>To fill the playlist just browse the database with mouse or
keyboard. The enter key, double clicking or pressing the right
mouse button will add the track to the bottom of the playlist. A
right mouse button click on a folder will add all contents and
sub-contents. Double clicking, Pressing delete or the right mouse
button will delete all selected tracks in the playlist. Click and
hold an entry to move it.

name, the full pathname will be searched. Pressing enter will start
the search, wildcard searching using "*" is supported. Found entries
can be moved to the playlist by selecting them and double clicking,
pressing enter or the right mouse button. Pressing delete will
remove them without moving into the playlist.

mouse button on the "ready" label.
