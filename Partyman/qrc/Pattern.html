<hr>
The patterns that are used to display the window title, the track inside
the player and the tracks in the playlist/searchlist are configured the
same way. Everything that is either static or dynamic content is enclosed
in pipe-signes ('|'). Dynamic content is marked by using a dollar- ('$')
or hash-sign ('#') according to the following table. The values of this
dynamic content are taken from the database and not from the files directly.
The tokens for accessing the database are pretty much self describing.
Numeric values can be accessed via the hash-sign ('#') and a number of
digits that shall be displayed. Only the right digits are display, if the
number is to big, so "#2DATE" will display a track from 1980 as "80" and
a track from 2008 as "08".
