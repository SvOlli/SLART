<dl>
 <dt>Connect On Startup</dt>
 <dd>Check this if you're too lazy to press the

 <dt>Crossfade Time:</dt>
 <dd>The number of seconds both player should play

 <dt><a name="slart">Use SLART UDP Communication:</a></dt>
 <dd>Partyman is part of
 "<a href="http://svolli.org/software/slart/">SvOlli's
 Little Audio Related Thingies</a>" or
 "<a href="http://svolli.org/software/slart/">SLART</a>"
 (external links) for short, which can use UDP for
 communicating with each other. It can be also used
 by Partyman for communicating with itself (see also
 <a href="#commandline">Command Line Parameters</a>).
 This switch activates this communication.</dd>
 <dt>Normalization:</dt>
 <dd>DerMixD, starting with svn version #399, can
 analyse the volume of a track, either by peak or
 by a power algorithm. Using this feature, Partyman
 can automatically set the volume, so that each track
 is player at the same volume level.
 </dd>
 <dt>External Logger:</dt>
 <dd>Each action like playing a track, stopping, pausing
 and skipping can be logged though an external application.
 Here it can be specified. See the 
 <a href="http://svolli.org/software/partyman/#external">Partyman
 webpage</a> (external link) for a more detailed explanation.</dd>
 <dt>Database File:</dt>
 <dd>The m3u file used as the database of all known
 audio tracks.</dd>
</dl>

running.
