<dl>
 <dt>Start/Stop via Partyman:</dt>
  <dd>Check this if you want DerMixD to be started
  during the initiation of the connection.</dd>
 <dt>Command:</dt>
  <dd>The command to run DerMixD.</dd>
 <dt>Parameters:</dt>
  <dd>The parameters to start DerMixD with<br>

 <dt>Normalization:</dt>
  <dd>DerMixD, starting with version 1.4.0, can

  by a power algorithm. Using this feature, Partyman
  can automatically set the volume, so that each track
  is played at the same volume level.

 <dt><a name="slart"></a>Use SLART UDP Communication:</dt>
  <dd>Partyman is part of
  "<a href="http://svolli.org/software/slart/">SvOlli's
  Little Audio Related Thingies</a>" or
  "<a href="http://svolli.org/software/slart/">SLART</a>"
  (external links) for short, which can use UDP for
  communicating with each other. It can be also used
  by Partyman for communicating with itself (see also
  <a href="#commandline">Command Line Parameters</a>).
  This switch activates this communication.</dd>
 <dt><a name="trayicon"></a>Show Tray Icon:</dt>
  <dd>The tray icon serves two purposes: first it'll let you
   start, stop, pause, or skip without the need on bringing
   the window to a visible place; second when you move your
   mousepointer over it, it'll show the currently played track.
   Click on it to play, pause and resume, double-click on it 
   for skipping to the next track.
   </dd>
 <dt>With Bubble:</dt>
  <dd>Additionally the track can also be displayed when it starts
  to play as a bubble from that tray icon.</dd>
 <dt>External Logger:</dt>
  <dd>Each action like playing a track, stopping, pausing
  and skipping can be logged though an external application.
  Here it can be specified. See the 
  <a href="http://svolli.org/software/partyman/#external">Partyman
  webpage</a> (external link) for a more detailed explanation.</dd>
 <dt>Increase Track Played Counter On Skip:</dt>
  <dd>When you press "Next", the track will be counted as played,

</dl></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="random"></a><b>Random Settings:</b>

<p><a name="display"></a><b>Display Settings:</b>
<dl>
 <dt>Title Display Pattern</dt>
  <dd>Set the pattern on how the window title is display when a track
  is played.</dd>
 <dt>Tray Icon Display Pattern</dt>
  <dd>Set the pattern on how the tool tip and bubble of the tray icon

  top right player.</dd>

  <dd>Decides if the moveable splitter between playlist and tabs
  (Help, Info, Search, Browse) is vertical or horizontal.</dd>
 <dt>Update Browser Tab</dt>
  <dd>This button initiates a rescan of the database for the
  filesystem tree displayed "Browse"-Tab. Since this can be time
  consuming and also resets the contents unfold state, it is not
  done automatically.</dd>
 <dt>Start Kiosk Mode</dt>
  <dd>Enter a password and the player will be locked, so that the
  track that's currently playing can not be interrupted or skipped.
  The settings and quitting program are also locked. To regain full
  functionality, click on the "Settings" button and enter the
  password you used during locking or kill and restart Partyman.
