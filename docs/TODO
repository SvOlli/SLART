all:
- new application for handling global keys (or extend creep?)
  - just task bar icon
  - main screen == config settings
- use QScript for generating filenames(?)
- QSqlDatabasePrivate::removeDatabase: connection 'qt_sql_default_connection' is still in use, all queries will cease to work.
- rename "Folder(s)" to "Label(s)" or "List(s)"

architecture:
- make configWidget a singleton for better global access
- move database and config widgets to simple singletons
- move database to an own thread
- try to handle QEvent::LanguageChange, so language change on the fly works
  - supply translations, loadable from filesys, .../lib
  - set texts not on constructor, but by setTexts() method

0.8:
- fix Funkytown Satellite connection
  - no connect
  - no generic message handler
- generate screenshots for all applications

extra:

Common:
- clean filename function
- Database::deleteFolder: delete entries from slart_tracks

Sorcerer:
- print warning if there are less than 3 files during update

Notorious:
- (0.8) add log of installed archives

Karmadrome:
- clicking favorite after folder button prevents folder buttons from saving
- "clear folder before import" does not work

Funkytown:

Stripped:

  - split tracks with long silence
  - handshake encoder data

  - implement as a setting
- auto read-toc
  - with cdrom-dialog and Satellite
- request on overwrite
- use Notorious database
? move encoders to QPlugins
- removal of leading / trailing zeros in audio data

Partyman:
? better random init via /dev/urandom
  - only if exists
? auto-switch to info
- check all error handling
- back-to-back optional instead of crossfade
  - auto back-to-back when track++ and same title

Rubberbandman:
- dragging of filesystem-item does select entry but not update file information
- "delete" does not work every time
- "add folder"/"remove folder"
- improve Database Tab
- search in "Partyman"-Tab
  - rename "Partyman"-Tab

Innuendo:
