Partyman:
- stopping does not write current playlist
- drag from browser
? better random init via /dev/urandom
  - only if exists
? auto-switch to info
- check all error handling
- back-to-back optional instead of crossfade
  - auto back-to-back when track++ and same album

all:
- add global option to make sure that window is placed on current screen
- new application for handling global keys (or extend creep?)
  - just task bar icon
  - main screen == config settings
- use QScript for generating filenames(?)
- QSqlDatabasePrivate::removeDatabase: connection 'qt_sql_default_connection' is still in use, all queries will cease to work.
- rename "Folder(s)" to "Group(s)"(!)
- add autocompeters to Partyman and Stripped for TrackInfo::displayString

architecture:
- make configWidget a singleton for better global access
- move database and config widgets to simple singletons
- move database to an own thread
  - on big updates do "intermediate commits"
  - access: ->slot(obj,cmd)->progress->QMetaMethod::invoke(obj,...)
- try to handle QEvent::LanguageChange, so language change on the fly works
  - supply translations, loadable from filesys, .../lib
  - set texts not on constructor, but by setTexts() method

translations:
- Innuendo
- Partyman
- Karmadrome
- Stripped
- Funkytown
- Notorious
